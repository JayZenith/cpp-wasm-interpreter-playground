# cpp-wasm-interpreter-playground

Run a **C++ interpreter compiled to WebAssembly** directly in your browser.

This project demonstrates a minimal but complete C++ interpreterâ€”including tokenizer, parser, and AST evaluationâ€”compiled to WebAssembly (WASM) and exposed in a React-based playground. You can **write, run, and reset C++ code snippets instantly in the browser**, with no server required.

## ðŸš€ Key Features

- **C++ Interpreter**  
  A minimal but real interpreter supporting variables, expressions, conditionals, and basic statements.

- **WebAssembly Compilation**  
  The interpreter is written in C++17 and compiled to WASM via **Emscripten**, making it runnable in any modern browser.

- **Browser Playground**  
  A React frontend with a built-in editor, run/reset buttons, and example snippets.

- **Real-Time Output**  
  Immediate code evaluation with a console-like output area.

- **Startup-Ready Demo**  
  Demonstrates how to bridge low-level systems programming with modern front-end deployment.
